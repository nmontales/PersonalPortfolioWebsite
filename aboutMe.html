            <h1> About </h1>
            <p>
                I'm currently a third year student at Pasadena City College and am majoring in computer science.
                I like to learn about new technology coming out whether it be cars, computers, monitors 
                keyboards, etc. I also enjoy learning new programming skills and practicing on the ones that 
                I already know. Through this repeated practice I hope to improve myself as a programmer and 
                to gain new knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal in the future is to strive to get better at programming, and to experience all that the 
                world of computer science has to offer. The fields I'm particularly interested in pursuing are 
                web development, software engineering, and data security. 
            </p>

                I first garnered interest in computer science in my sophomore year of high school. I saw my cousin 
                had built a new computer and since then I was hooked on all that computers had to offer. I started my 
                coding journey in college taking my first course as an intro to c++ class. From there I learned object 
                oriented programing, to data structures and algorithms. Now I'm pursuing more knowledge in HTML/CSS, bash,
                and dabbling a little in assembly.
